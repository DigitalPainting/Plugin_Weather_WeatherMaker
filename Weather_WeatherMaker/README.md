# Weather Maker Plugin

Digital Ruby's Weather Maker asset is a wonderful asset that delivers many features. This plugin provides your Digital Painting with support for these features, including a Day Night Cycle and complete Weather system with sky.

# Usage

Add the `WeatherMakerCommon/Scenes/WeatherMakerCommon` scene as an additive scene.

If you main scene already has a manager with a `DayNightCycle` and/or `WeatherSystem` component you should remove or disable these.

If your main scene already has a camera you should either remove it or ensure that it has (at least) the same components as the `WeatherMakerMainCamera`, and delete this latter camera.
